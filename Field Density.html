<h1><strong>Field Density</strong> Test</h1>
<h2> <i>Aim of conducting</i></h2>
<p> measure the degree of compaction of a compacted soil <BR> conducted in road under construction after each layer compaction , large building like football ground</p>
<p class="my-group"> Tools and Materils needed:<p/>
<ol>
<li>heater</li>
<li>Balance</li>
<li>Densitometer with cone </li>
<li>Spoon</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
<li> plate</li>
</ol>
<p class="my-group">procedure to conduct: </p>
<p>*Dig a hole of 12-15 m depth with the same diameter of <strong>plate</strong><br * Measure the weight of soil from hole <br> *have a weighed mass of sand in <strong>densitometer </strong>and allow sand to fill the hole <br>* measure weight of sand remains in densitometer and calculate the sand in hole and one in cone (already known) <br> * Take a sample of soil , measure its weight (dry weight) and burn on heater and after records its weight( dry weight)<br>*Clculate the <strong>Moisture content</strong>, MoC=weight of wter*100/dry soil
<br> *Also calculate <STRONG>dry density of soil </STRONG> <mark>Ddry</mark>=wet density*100/(100+moisture content) 
<br><br><br><br>


 Finaly Degree of Compaction = Dry density of soil*100/MDD <br>
MDD= of filler materials <br> 
OMC=optimum moisture content of filler materils
</p>
<p class="my-group">Conclusion: <br> the accepted degree of compaction is one beyond <em><strong> 97%</em></p>
